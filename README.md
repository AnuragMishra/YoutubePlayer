# YoutubePlayer

YoutubePlayer is a JavaScript wrapper for Youtube's flash player and provides a simpler interface for listening to video playback events by the flash player. You can add multiple videos on the page by creating an object of YoutubePlayer for each video, and can subscribe to events on that object.
	
Thanks to James Coglan for coming up with some [great ideas](http://blog.jcoglan.com/2008/05/22/dispatching-youtube-api-events-to-individual-javascript-objects/) on overcoming the limited Flash-JavaScript communication offered by the Youtube APIs with a very well designed interface.

# Usage

Include the YoutubePlayer and its dependency SWFObject.

	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/swfobject/2.2/swfobject.js"></script>
	<script src="YoutubePlayer.js"></script>

For each video that is to be embedded on the page, add a placeholder div element on the page and give it an `id`.

	<div id="inception"></div>
	<div id="easy-a"></div>

To replace the placeholder div with the actual flash player, simply instantiate an object of YoutubePlayer and pass it the id of the placeholder div and the id of the Youtube video.

	var inceptionTrailer = new YoutubePlayer('inception', '66TuSJo4dZM');
	var easyATrailer = new YoutubePlayer('easy-a', 'DL7W6pEuAW0');

To listen to playback events, add a handler to the above objects for the supported events.

	inceptionTrailer.on('paused', function() {
		alert("Paused Inception's trailer");
	});

	easyATrailer.on('playing', function() {
		alert('Started playing Easy-A's trailer"")
	});

Google code provides a [hosted version](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/hosted_library) of the library which can be included (compressed)
